[pyswip](https://pypi.org/project/pyswip/)

# Usage

Experimental training and testing data are in the folder data/{task-name}/data/{train|test}

Induced programs are in the folder data/{task-name}/program/

Experimental results are in the folder data/{task-name}/results/

To reproduce the experimental results (train and test), you can run:

`python benchmark2.py e1`.  (for tables 2, 4, 5)

`python benchmark2.py e2`. (for table 6)
